Ok, how do you people rivet your jeans? This is literally my 5th pair and I'm still struggling. 

The first time I put rivets on anything was my first pair of Ginger Jeans (I've now made several pairs of Gingers, so shout-out to [Closet Core Patterns](https://www.closetcorepatterns.com/) for drafting an excellent pattern!!!).
If I recall correctly, I followed the online tutorials from Closet Core patterns: [this blog post with pictures](https://www.closetcorepatterns.com/ginger-sewalong-pt-14-installing-denim-rivets-buttons/) and [this helpful video tutorial from Heather Lou](use://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8xL1q1wvUE).
Heather Lou makes installing rivets look really easy.
It's not. 

<hr endexcerpt="true"/>

For those of you who haven't installed a rivet before (mercy on your soul), it works by pushing a metal post attached to the back of the rivet into the rounded rivet cap through a hole in the fabric that you poke using an awl. 
Before installing the rivet, you have to clip down the post to exactly the right length.
If you cut it too short, not enough pokes out the other side of the fabric and the cap won't stick on.
If you cut it too long, it will punch straight through the cap producing a very weird rivet that is now stuck on your pants.
Then you have to install the rivet by banging on it with a metal hammer.
If you bang on it in a lopsided way, you can produced a smashed, lopsided result.
My first pair of jeans has some quite exotic, crumply-looking rivets.
I also had to re-install at least one of them because it fell out shortly after putting it in my closet, which is an alarming situation for a sewist because it leaves a raw open hole in the garment you just spent days (weeks?) hand-crafting.

By my third pair of Gingers, I'd gotten more consistent at putting in rivets, but it was still taking me a good chunk of time. 
So I decided to invest in a rivet press.

I used the press on my 4th pair of Gingers (I wear a lot of skinny jeans, ok!). 
I kind of hoped the press would magically work perfectly and I could have a perfectly installed rivet with a snap of my fingers. 
It did not.
You still have to clip the rivets to the right height.
Sometimes you push the press down and the rivet doesn't stick. 
On the bright side, the rivet cap tends to look a litte smoother than when I was hammering it.
Also I could do my riveting at the kitchen table, instead of kneeling on the concrete floor of our side patio, which is what I was doing before. 
I figured that, much like with the hammered rivets, I would improve with practice, and that with another couple of pairs of jeans I would be a rivet-installing machine! 

Today I riveted my 5th pair of jeans (blog post coming soon hehe), and EMOJI HERE UGGGHHHHHHHH

I could not get the press to work for my life.
The cap kept getting stuck in the die, the little cylindar-shaped piece that holds it in place. 
Even if the rivet held at first, it usually fell apart as I tried to yank free the cap.
I tried covering the cap with a thin rag before placing it into the die; this helped a little with the wedging problem (and had the amusing side-effect of punching perfect rivet-sized circles into the rag). 
But it didn't produce many more good rivets; they kept not sticking or getting deformed as the rag slipped against the die.

Stinging with defeat, bitterly swallowing the uselessness of my much-anticipated riveting press, I returned to my original option: the hammer. 

I got the rivets on there eventually, but I feel like at this point it should not take me many hours and several rounds of debugging to install 7 rivets.
Does anyone have any insight into this riveting problem? 
How do you guys install your rivets? 
Can you recommend tutorials?
Does it work consistently?
How long does it take? 
Help!
