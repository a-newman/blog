I have complicated feelings about bikinis, which is not surprising considering that bikinis have a really complicated history. 

On one hand--let's be real--bikinis are a totally impractical piece of swimwear. 
As someone who enjoys swimming in the ocean, I highly prioritize a bathing suit feature I call "security"--the ability to stay put on the body despite considerable jostling.
My parents make fun of me this, but anyone who has tried to body surf in a bikini understands the issue here. 
Last time I tried, I almost lost both my bra pads and my briefs in the ocean. 
I had to plan an escape plan in case I had to flag my brother to come bring me a towel.
If I'm trying to enjoy my day at the beach, I don't want to have to keep checking if my swimsuit is still on!

On the other hand, I like to look cute. 
Heck, I have a blog documenting all the many hours I spend on my wardrobe.
Bikinis are stylish.
I like wearing them, and I like being able to show off my body in a socially acceptable context.
In other words, my teenage days of achieving bathing suit security by walking into the ocean fully clothed, dressed in a rash guard and knee-length trunks, are over.

...And that brings me to all the symbolic baggage around bikinis.
In the bikini, you have a piece of clothing that is, all at the same time, a) an expression of women's liberation, b) a symbol of sexualization and objectification, and c) completely mundane.

## An overloaded symbol

Let me explain!
**a)** At the time the bikini was developed, women going swimming while fully dressed was the rule, not the exception. 
The creation of a navel-baring outfit was completely scandalous. 
The attire was promptly banned in France (France!). 
As mores about modesty and female sexuality shifted, so did attitudes about swimwear. 
In other words, as women gained more sexual freedom, showing your body in public was not as scandalous.
Now, in a modern world awash in bathing suit options (one-pieces! rash guards! tankinis!) many women (including me) _choose_ bikinis as their swimear of choice.
Plus, here's another tidbit that links the invention of the bikini to women's burgeoning role in society: the skimpy design may have been inspired by materials rationing during the Second World War, the same conflict that brought women into the work force en masse for the first time. 

**b)** If you're in doubt about the motivation behind the creation of the bikini, you clearly haven't read the early ad copy.
And at the time of their creation, they were clearly marketed as such. 
They were designed by a dude--marked as "xxxxxxx"--
They have stayed an enduring sex symbol--from the Victoria's Secret fashion show, to the Sports illustrated swimsuit edition, to xxxxxx. 
Recently, there's been pushback against using bikinis to objectify women.
Even the Miss USA Pageant has admitted that parading accomplished ladies around in swimsuits is not about inner beauty.
Victoria's Secret is having financial problems, and it's now (just now?) viewed as unacceptable to blame victims of sexual assault based on their fashion choices (at least in the US).

To be clear: I do _not_ mean to imply that a woman wearing a bikini, especially on a runway or in front of a camera, is automatically disempowered or objectified.
To the contrary--people like [Ashley](https://www.eonline.com/news/621707/sports-illustrated-swimsuit-issue-features-first-plus-size-model-size-16-beauty-ashley-graham-see-the-pic) [Graham](https://www.bustle.com/style/ashley-graham-swimsuits-for-all-ad-unretouched) and [Valentina Sampaio](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/business/media/valentina-sampaio-transgender-sports-illustrated.html) turn the sex-symbol nature of the bikini on its head, using it as a tool to expand the definition of what is sexy, and to make women feel good about themselves, which is :clap: :clap: what fashion is about.
Women can and should wear what they want.
That is, women should wear bikinis because they feel like it...not because men do.
The distinction between sexiness and sexualization is important and subtle, and part of why a bikini is such a complex garment.

**c)** And in spite of all this remarkable complexity...most of the time bikinis are unremarkable! 
They are perhaps the most common piece of female swimwear in the modern US, and (outside of my rambling) don't warrant much of a mention. 
They don't even date to the 20th century! 
Roman women were wearing them way before we started freaking out about exposed belly buttons.

All this to say...it's very confusing!!!
As a sewist I like to think about what my clothes are saying, and here, there is a mixed message. 
Can I wear a bikini without buying into chauvanism? 
Can I go swimming without stepping into a snake pit of cultural context? 
And I mean, raise your hand if you would like your clothing to be functional and sexy without being sexualizing. 
Don't we all? 
Is that even possible?

Guys, I haven't even gotten to the etymology of the word bikini.

## Bikini Atoll

The bikini swimsuit is literally named after, I am not kidding, the United States' nuclear bomb testing site during the Cold War. 

Like, let that sink in for a second how _bizarre_ that is.

<!-- Straw poll: Did you know that already?!?! Let me know. --> 

The bikini was named after the atomic testing at Bikini Atoll, which started in July 1946.
That's less than a year after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and days before the debut of Louis Réard's scandalous design.

Monsieur Réard was not original in his idea to analogize female sexuality, or its effect on men, to a giant explostion. 
The use of the word "bombshell" to describe an attractive woman had been around since the 1930s. 
The first weapon detonated at Bikini Atoll, 4 days before the revelation of the modern bikini, was named Gilda after Rita Hayworth's character in the eponymous movie. 
A contemporaneous PR attempt involved the unveiling of a slightly-less-skimpy bathing suit called the _atome_, purportedly named after the smallest known particle of matter, but inviting association with the atom bomb (...which ironically relies upon the behavior of subatomic particles...I digress).

Réard was no doubt trying to capitalize on the publicity of the recent test of the Gilda bomb when he named his swimsuit.
However, the legacy of that name was still far from settled.
The testing at Bikini continued for another decade and involved another 22 bombs. 

Perhaps the most famous denotation at Bikini was the 1954 "Castle Bravo" test. 
It's famous because it was the biggest nuclear weapon ever tested by the United States, and also the worst nuclear weapons accident in history\*.
Scientists underestimated the yield of the bomb, leading to an explosion two-and-a-half-times bigger than expected\*\*. 

\*[Thank goodness for that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1961_Goldsboro_B-52_crash). 

\*\*Here's what happened (warning: nerdy technical content ahead). 
The bomb used in the Castle Bravo test was a fusion bomb (aka a hydrogen bomb or a thermonuclear bomb); that means it worked by releasing energy created from fusing together small atoms (hydrogen) into bigger atoms (helium). 
The fuel for the bomb is provided by lithium deuteride (a molecule composed of a lithium atom and deuteride, a particular hydrogen isotope). 
Lithium also has different isotopes. 
Most natural lithium is lithium-7 (i.e. the nucleus contains 3 protons and 4 neutrons for a total of 7 particles).
The scientists thought that only lithium-6 could sustain a fusion reaction, so they increased the fraction of lithium-6 in their lithium deuteride as much as they could, to about 40% of the mixture. 
But they were wrong, and *all* the lithium--including the 60% of the fuel that was lithium-7--contributed to the reaction.
That's where the factor of ~2.5 comes from<sup>2</sup>.
Chapter 3 of _Atomic Accidents_ has an even more detailed explanation!


This and a cascade of other scientific errors and outright negligence--deciding to conduct the test in spite of shifting winds that brought the fallout over inhabited land, failure to recognize [the effect of radioactive iodine on the thyroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-131)), and a huge underestimation of the amount of radioactive strontium ingested in the local food--led to multiple forced relocations and elevated rates of cancer among the inhabitants of the Marshall Islands<sup>1</sup>. 
Navy sailors were exposed to fallout and suffered burns <sup>2</sup>.
Fallout from the oversized explosion also afflicted several Japanese fishermen (who were technically outside the containment zone) with radiation sickness, leading to an [international incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daigo_Fukury%C5%AB_Maru)<sup>1,2</sup>.
Residual radioactivity from this and other 20th century nuclear weapons tests still contributes slightly to the background radiation we all experience on a daily basis<sup>1</sup>, an ecological change significant enough that it has been proposed as the physical marker of a new geological era dominated by human effects on the environment, the "Anthropocene"<sup>3</sup>.

Given all these lifechanging and planet-changing effects, it's kind of crazy that for a lot of people, the most salient result of the Bikini Atoll tests is probably a two-piece bathing suit.
I find it equally crazy the extent to which the word "bikini" has been scrubbed of its meaning. 
We literally walk around all the time casually alluding to each other's swimwear as thermonuclear warheads and radioactive fallout.
I guess it would be even crazier if we did that knowingly.

## I guess I should talk about my sewing project now

This blog post was supposed to be a quick one about the one-piece swimsuit I whipped together as an alternative to the "insecure" bikini I made earlier this summer.

But as I started writing about the allures and the shortcomings of the bikini, I realized that there was a much more interesting story than my bathing suit here.

It is mind-boggling to me that a single piece of clothing is both so complex and so quotidian; that it has become xxxx; that this basic vocab word in our fashion vocabulary--the default swimsuit for women--is actually so loaded, and most of the time you don't think about it.

Spare a thought for that next time you put on a bikini.

I mean, don't we all? 
Is that even possible? 

I would like to be sexy without being sexualized. 
I would also like to have functional clothing that does not interfere my non-fashion activities, in either functionality or message.
Is that even possible?



I had an embarassing problem at the beach the other day. 

Earlier in the summer, I made this bikini: 

<!-- picture of bikini -->

It turned out cute, and I was very happy with it...until I wore it in the water, and found that it failed one of my cardinal standards for bathing suit construction--it was not _secure_. 
My parents make fun of me for prioritizing secure bathing suits, but anyone who has tried to wear a bikini in the ocean understands the issue here. 
They do not stay put on the body.
On my first round of body surfing, I almost lost both bra pads and my bottoms in the ocean. 
I had to plan out an escape route in case I had to flag my brother to come bring me a towel.

My feelings about bikinis are complicated.
If we're being honest, they are just a totally impractical piece of swimwear. 
If I'm trying to enjoy hanging out in the ocean I don't want to have to keep checking if my swimsuit is still on. 
But they have become the de facto uniform for swimming ladies, and I _do_ want to look cute and stylish. 
In other words, my teenage years of achieving bathing suit security by walking into the ocean fully clothed, dressed in a rash guard and knee-length trunks, are over.
Basically, I'd like to be able to be cute and functional at the same time.
And let's be real, functionality [has](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bustle) [rarely]() [been](https://www.outsideonline.com/2400562/how-womens-clothes-pockets-changed-over-time) a priority for women's clothing. 

(Side note: the [history of the bikinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_bikini) is actually quite interesting; they can be found in the historical record well before the 20th century (think 5600 BC), were influenced in their modern incarnation by some of the same wartime exigencies that first drove women into the workforce, and have become a symbol of both women's liberation and sexualization. 
The name "bikini" is itself a historical reference, being named for the [atomic bomb testing in Bikini Atoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_testing_at_Bikini_Atoll), which if you think about it, is really bizarre given [the legacy of the testing program there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Bravo).) 

All this to say that several days before my family's planned beach vacation this weekend, I realized that I had no secure bathing suits to wear in the ocean. 
So I gave myself one afternoon to whip one up. 

This is the first one-piece I've owned since I was in grade school. 
It feels kind of weird to be wearing cloth over my belly while going to the beach, haha. 
This is McCalls xxxxx. 

But actually, the history of the bikini is pretty interesting. 
It involves the intersection of culture, history, and science. 

The bikini was named after the atomic testing at Bikini Atoll, which started in July 1946, less than a year after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and days before the debut of Louis Réard's scandalous design.
He not original in his idea to analogize female sexuality, or its effect on men, with a giant explostion. 
The use of the word "bombshell" to describe an attractive woman was around since the 1930s. 
The first weapon detonated at Bikini Atoll, 4 days before the revelation of the modern bikini, was named Gilda after Rita Hayworth's character in the eponymous movie. 
A similar PR attempt involved the unveiling of a scandalously skimpy bathing suit called the _atome_, purportedly named after the smallest known particle of matter, but inviting association with the atom bomb, which ironically relies upon the behavior of subatomic particles.

Réard was no doubt trying to capitalize on the publicity of the recent test of the Gilda bomb with his design. 
However, the testing at Bikini Atoll continued for another decade and involved another 22 more bombs. 
Perhaps the most famous denotation at Bikini was the 1954 "Castle Bravo" test. 
It's famous because it was the worst accident involving a nuclear weapon in history.
Scientists underestimated the yield of the bomb, leading to an explosion two-and-a-half-times bigger than expected. 
This and a cascade of other scientific errors/negligence--deciding to conduct the test in spite of indications that winds were shifting towards populated areas, an assumption that radioactive iodine would not be harmful to humans, and failure to recognize the infiltration of radioactive strontium into the local food supply--lead to forced evacuations, increased incidence of cancer among the inhabitants of the Marshall Islands, and an international incident involving Japaense fishermen with acute radiation poisoning.
Not to mention that radioactive fallout from this and other 20th century nuclear weapons tests contributes an appreciate amount to the background radiation we all experience on a daily basis, an ecological change so significant that it has been proposed as the physical marker of a new geological era dominated by human effects on the environment, the "Anthropocene".
All this to say
