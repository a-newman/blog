![My newest pair of jeans pockets, aren't they great?!!.](../images/jeans_pockets/pockets_2.jpg)


If I'm going to make blue jeans at home, I figure, they need to have fancy pockets.

But the question is _how_ to transfer a really jaw-dropping design from my brain to the denim.
My machine doesn't have super fancy embroidery settings or anything.
I am also not an artist or a graphic designer.

Fortunately, my experience as an artsy computer scientist has left me peculiarly prepared for just this situation.
I have some experience using sub-par tools to achieve reasonable production value. 
I have Ubuntu installed on my computer because I find Windows extremely frustrating for doing development/research work, and Macs are expensive :cry: 
Unfortunately, a lot of everyday applications are designed for Windows/Mac only :cry: which means I make do with a lot of free and open-source software.
Let's just say that I make the figures in my papers in Google Slides :grimacing:

<!--I managed to figure out a pretty effective way to get some fairly complex designs onto the back pockets.
It has actually worked surprisingly well-better than I thought it would, and I was able to get some complex curves to render more faithfully than I had expected (like the cursive in initials in the photo above!). -->

So here's how I made my most recent pair of jeans pockets.
It involves free software, an online graphing calculator, raiding the craft closet, and as little free-handing as possible.
But in all seriousness, this technique, hacky as it may be, has actually yielded some surprisingly good results! 
I'm very happy with the quality and complexity of the designs I've managed to reproduce.

## Step 1: The Design
