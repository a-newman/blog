This is my first pair of non-skinny jeans! 

Skinny jeans have been my bottom-half wardrobe staple literally since middle school, which is when I stopped thinking that fashion was stupid. 
But now that I'm on a jeans-making tear, I've decided to expand my wardrobe a little.

This pattern is the [Morgan boyfriend jeans](https://store.closetcorepatterns.com/products/morgan-boyfriend-jeans-pattern?variant=18623997062) from Closet Core Patterns. 
I bought this pattern after making about a gazillion pairs of the [Ginger jeans](https://store.closetcorepatterns.com/products/ginger-skinny-jeans-pattern) because I thought it was super cute and wanted to try a new style.

The fabric is a selvedge denim from [Fabric Mart](https://www.fabricmartfabrics.com/).
Fabric Mart is the best.
About a month ago, I was looking for a piece of selvedge denim specifically for this project, and was getting frustrated because I couldn't find anything to my satisfaction online. 
Then, boom--the next day, Fabric Mart came to the rescue with a bunch of newly-posted selvedge denim :heart:
I like the selvedge on this fabric so I used it on the pockets as well as of course the cuff.

As far as sizing, I cut out a size 10 (which is what I use for the Gingers) and did a quarter-inch ["full seat adjustment"](https://www.closetcorepatterns.com/jean-fitting-adjustments-best-fitting-jeans/) on the inseam (which I sometimes require on pants).
(Disclaimer: I do realize that the Gingers and the Morgans are not cut from the same pattern block and as such don't fit exactly the same, but I expected these sizes to give me a pretty good starting place.)
However, I ended up undoing the "full seat" aka big butt adjustment and taking in the crotch and the outseam substantially.
I probably actually needed a size 8, and might start from there next time. 

In the end, I'm pretty happy with the fit, except (this is a nit, I know) the waistband is definitely angled forward--the back waistband sits up higher than the front. 
But the front crotch (which is in my opinion the hardest part of the jeans to get right) turned out well. 
I think the jeans have a good level of slack in them.
They're flattering without being super tight fitting.

*They're pretty comfy and quite roomy!*

I already wrote some blog posts about [putting in the rivets](/posts/riveting/) and [making the pockets](/posts/fancy-jeans-pockets/) on these jeans, so you can check those out if you're interested!

*Some detail pictures of the jeans. I love the bright lining fabric and how it matches the selvedge.*

Ironically, I haven't even worn these jeans for real yet. :joy: 
This blog post is their first "outing".
It's been hot in Los Angeles and I've been mostly stuck in the house, so I haven't had an occasion to wear long pants.
The nice thing about making jeans is that they're never going to go out of style. 
They'll still be hip after COVID is gone, and I'm sure I'll get a ton of wear out of them.

*P.S. My friend Yida HAND-KNIT the shirt I'm wearing in this post.* :hushed: *Isn't it cute? It will be getting a lot of wear with these jeans :)*
